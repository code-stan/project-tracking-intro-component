## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS animation
- Javascript


### What I learned

I used "Open sans" font which was not the required font, i had to improvise and used
```css
.this-style{
   font-stretch: extra-condensed;
 }
 ```
to give it that "Barlow" font look

### Target for this project
- Application of animations of the header
- Compressing the type-face to meet the look of other font.


### Continued development

I want to continue to focus more on transition and hover designs. Though my present knowledge on it, is sturdy
